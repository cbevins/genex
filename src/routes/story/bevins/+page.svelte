<H1>Lineage of Grandfather Samuel Bevins</H1>

<H2>Immigrants</H2>

<P>
The first direct ancestors of Samuel Bevins arrived in America in 1845
<Ref {refs} key={'1'}/>.

They included his grandparents <Person ggp={2}>William Longford Bevins</Person>, age 30,
and wife <Person ggp={2}>Mary Bolt</Person> (or Bott), age 23.

Accompanying them were their 3 children, including Samuel's future father,
<Person ggp={1}>William Alfred Bevins</Person>, who was then 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
<Person ggp={2}>William Longford Bevins</Person> was born on 4 Mar 1815 in the ancestral hometown of
<Place>Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, England</Place>.

The Bevins line in Newbold Verdon goes back at least 5 more generations to our
<Person ggp={7}>William Bevins</Person> and <Person ggp={7}>Judith Baker</Person>, both born there in 1665.
</P>
<P>
William Longford Bevins was 22 when he first married Ruth Gent (20) on 13 Nov 1837 in Burton Upon Trent, Staffordshire.
She gave birth to John Henry on 9 Mar 1838 in Ashby de la Zouch, Leicestershire.
But Ruth died within the month, and William apparently moved back to Newbold Verdon.
In Jan 1840 he married 17 year old Mary Bolt in nearby Market Bosworth, Leicestershire.
She gave birth to a son Joseph in 1841, and then to our 2<sup>nd</sup>William Alfred on 12 Jun 1843.
</P>
<P>
By 1845, William and Mary were on their way to America.  They most likely made landfall in New York,
as Mary soon thereafter gave birth to daughter Sarah Anne in Newark, NJ on 9 Aug 1845.
</P>
<Note>
I have not been able to locate any documentation of William and Mary Bevins' passage to America.
There were no centralized immigration processing sites in the US before Castle Gardens opened in New York 1855
followed by Ellis Island in 1892. Rather, passengers were inspected onboard the arriving ship.
While New York was the major port of immigration, others included Phildelphia, Boston, and Baltimore.
We do know that Mary's 3rd child William Alfred was born 12 Jun 1843 in England, and 4th child Sarah Anne
was born on 9 Aug 1845 in New Jersey, leaving just a 26 month window for their passage to occur.
The 1900 USFC also states that William ALfred arrived in America in 1845.
Atlantic crossings were made by wooden hulled sailing ships until 1938, when wooden hulled
paddle wheeled steamship service started.

According to https://www.europeana.eu/en/exhibitions/leaving-europe/departure-and-arrival :
In the 1840s, steamships began transporting wealthy passengers while the poor immigrants still made
the voyage to America by sailing vessel. In the 1860s and 1870s, the size of steamships increased,
and companies transported poor families in steerage at a low cost. 
</Note>

<P>
The 1850 USFC places the family in Townsend, Huron, OH.
William's occupation was listed as farmer, and his real estate was valued at $460.
According to the census, neither William nor Mary could read or write, but their children were attending school.
A fifth child, Mary, had been born the previous year.
</P>
<P>
    How they get to Ohio?
</P>

<P>The family moved again in 1855, this time to Annawan, Henry, IL.</P>
